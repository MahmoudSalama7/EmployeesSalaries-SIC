# Salary and Job Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing salary data across various countries, job roles, education levels, and departments. The analysis includes identifying trends, correlations, and insights that can help in understanding the distribution of salaries, job rates, and permissions. The project utilizes Python for data processing and Power BI for visualization.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values, transforming variables, and creating necessary fields.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating the dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights. This includes generating summary statistics and visualizations.

- **Visualization**: 
  - Python: Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for various plots like histograms, line plots, scatter plots, and bar charts.
  - Power BI: Interactive dashboards and reports are created to visualize key insights, including slicers with search functionality.

- **Correlation Analysis**: Assessing relationships between variables such as Salary, Job Rate, Permissions, and Years of Experience to understand their interdependencies.

## Key Insights

- **Salary Distribution**: Analysis of salary distribution across different countries, departments, and education levels, with a focus on outliers and skewness.
  
- **Country and Department Analysis**:
  - Syria and UAE have the lowest average salaries, with a significant presence of academics and doctors.
  - Egypt shows the highest average salaries, with a large number of academics.

- **Years of Experience**:
  - A general trend of increasing salaries with more years of experience, except for those with 6 years of experience, which show an anomaly with the lowest mean salary.

- **Skewness in Academic Salaries**:
  - The skewness observed in academic salaries indicates a possible prevalence of lower salary ranges within this group.

- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - The correlation matrix highlights the relationships between salary, job rate, permissions, and years of experience.

## Business Recommendations

- **Country-Specific Salary Strategies**:
  - Review and potentially adjust salary structures in countries with lower pay scales to ensure competitive compensation, especially in regions like Syria and UAE.

- **Departmental Salary Adjustments**:
  - Investigate the reasons behind skewed salary distributions in specific departments (e.g., academia) and consider interventions to address any disparities.

- **Experience-Based Salary Policies**:
  - Address the anomaly in the salary trend for those with 6 years of experience to ensure that salary progression aligns with years of service.

## Technical Recommendations

- **Data Quality**:
  - Improve the data collection process to ensure accurate and consistent recording of years of experience and other key variables.

- **Visualization Tools**:
  - Utilize Power BIâ€™s advanced features, like custom visuals and interactive dashboards, to provide deeper insights and improve user engagement.

- **Further Analysis**:
  - Conduct deeper statistical analyses, such as regression modeling or clustering, to uncover hidden patterns and refine business strategies.

## How to Use

1. **Python Code**:
   - The Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used for data processing and analysis are included in the repository.
   - To run the code, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.).

2. **Power BI Dashboard**:
   - The Power BI file (.pbix) contains all the visualizations and dashboards created for this project.
   - Open the file in Power BI Desktop to explore the data and interact with the reports.
